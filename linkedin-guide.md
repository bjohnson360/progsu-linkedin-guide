# 💼 progsu LinkedIn Guide

Your LinkedIn profile is your **public resume**, your **networking hub**, and your **referral machine**.  
Optimizing it is one of the highest-return investments you can make as a CS student as it can literally double your referral rate and unlock opportunities faster than any coding platform.

---

## 🧠 The Golden Idea

LinkedIn isn’t just a professional profile, it’s your **warm lead generator**.  
Every connection, post, or update can lead to a recruiter seeing your profile, a referral, or a job interview.

> 💡 **Goal:** Treat LinkedIn like a living system that constantly works for you.

---

## 🧩 1. Profile Foundation

### ✅ Profile Picture
Your photo is the *first impression* so make it count.

**Checklist**
- 📸 Recent (within 1–2 years)
- Clear, well-lit, high-quality (use natural light or Portrait mode)
- Neutral or smiling expression
- Simple, uncluttered background
- Business casual attire
- No selfies so please have someone else take it
- Make your photo **public**

**Pro Tip:** Hire a student photographer or use iPhone Portrait mode outdoors in soft light. Take hella photos and pick the best.

---

### 🏙️ Background Banner
Create a banner that fits your personality and tech interests.

**Ideas:**
- City skyline or your campus  
- Abstract tech background  
- Nature photo for contrast  

> 🎨 Ensure contrast between your banner and profile photo — avoid “warm on warm.”

Use [Canva](https://www.canva.com/create/linkedin-banners/) or Figma templates to design one easily.

---

### 🧑‍💼 Headline
Your headline appears everywhere so make it keyword-rich, confident, and professional.

**Formula:**  
`[Field/Interest] | [Technical Skills] | [Goal or Value]`

**Examples:**
- Computer Science Major | iOS & Web Developer | Passionate About AI and Education  
- CS @ Georgia State University | SWE Intern @ IBM | Building Scalable Mobile Apps  

> 🚫 Avoid words like “Aspiring” because you *are* what you’re becoming.

---

## 🧾 2. About Section (Your Story)

This is your *personal elevator pitch* which will be a 3–5 paragraph narrative that blends who you are, what you do, and where you’re headed.

**Structure:**
1. Introduce yourself (student, school, passions)
2. Highlight your technical skills & experiences
3. Share what motivates you or what you’re seeking next

**Example:**
> I’m a Computer Science major at Georgia State University with interests in mobile development, AI, and data-driven design. I’ve built projects ranging from iOS apps to deep learning models and enjoy turning creative ideas into impactful tech.  
>  
> I’m currently seeking opportunities to grow as a software engineer and collaborate with teams building innovative solutions.

---

## 🧰 3. Featured Section

Show, don’t tell.  
Add visuals or links to:
- GitHub projects
- Personal website or portfolio
- Resume (PDF)
- Articles or research
- Hackathon wins or demo videos

> 📎 Make it easy for recruiters to *see your work immediately.*

---

## 💼 4. Experience Section

Your experience shows your growth and technical journey, even if you’re early in your career.

**Tips:**
- Include all relevant work, internships, research, and club roles.
- Add non-technical work too (shows responsibility and initiative).
- Use 3–4 short **paragraphs**, not just bullet points:
  1. What was your role and team?
  2. What project did you lead or contribute to?
  3. What impact did it have (metrics, improvements, lessons)?

**Example:**
> **Software Engineering Intern – TechCorp**  
> *May 2025 – August 2025*  
> I collaborated with the data team to build a React-based dashboard for 200+ employees. I optimized API queries, reducing load time by 30%. This project helped improve decision-making speed across departments.

> 💡 Treat *club leadership*, *research*, or *volunteering* as experience if it showcases initiative or teamwork.

---

## 🧩 5. Projects Section

Highlight the technical side of your journey.  
Include academic, hackathon, or personal projects where each one tells a story about your skills.

**Format Example:**
> **OGRE – Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Study App**  
> A mobile app that allows undergraduate students to study for the 3 core areas of the GRE.  
> *Tech Stack:* Swift, SwiftUI, Firebase  
>  
> - Designed UI with SwiftUI  
> - Integrated Firebase authentication and real-time data syncronization  
> - Reduced app load time by 15%  
>  
> [🔗 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/) | [🎥 Demo Video](https://youtu.be/)

---

## 🧠 6. Skills & Endorsements

Add both **technical** and **soft** skills, and get peers to endorse them.

**Examples:**
- Python, Java, Swift, React, Node.js  
- Git/GitHub, SQL, Firebase, AWS  
- Communication, Teamwork, Leadership

> ✅ Link each skill to the experience or project where you used it.

---

## 🧑‍🏫 7. Education, Awards, & Extras

Include:
- University, degree, and expected graduation date
- GPA (if 3.5+)
- Coursework (e.g., Data Structures, Algorithms, OS)
- Certifications (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.)

Focus on:
- Engineers and interns at your target companies
